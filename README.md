## Requirements
You have to install WINE, and run `winecfg` to make sure everything is working properly

## Install EverQuest

## Patch files
Run `patch_files.sh` in the game's directory (Default: `/home/<user>/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Sony/Everquest/`\).

## Play
Run `launch_titanium.sh` to play.

# project1999-linux

## Requirements
You have to install WINE, and run `winecfg` to make sure everything is working properly

## Install EverQuest
Get a copy of EverQuest Titanium and install it. You can also copy an already installed of the game over to your machine, which is easier.
The default game directory is `~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Sony/EverQuest`

## Patch files
Run `patch_files.sh`.

This will make all the modifications needed to play on Project1999 servers.

## Play
Run `launch_titanium.sh` to play. (Note that I removed the taskset part because it would make the game run really slow)

## Thanks to:
- Zallarenya for the launch script
